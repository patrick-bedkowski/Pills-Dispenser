# Assembly

Since dispenser consists of 3 parts, it is straightforward to put it together.

__Top slider__ is relatively easy to assemble, just slide the part to the slot of the body.

__The button__ is the part that is worth noting. On the rear side you can find __2 holes__, they are meant for springs that prevent the button from collapsing.

## How to acquire springs?

You can find appropriate spring in almost every pen. Springs used inside should measure approximately 2,5 cm.
__Just cut it in half, and you have two springs that are ready to be mounted with a glue on the button__

## How to join button with a body?
After mounting the springs with a glue try to gently push the button inside a slot of a body part.
